from typing import Optional

async def play_song(ctx, song_url: str, volume: Optional[float] = None):
    """
    Play a song in the voice channel.

    Args:
        ctx: Discord context object
        song_url: URL of the song to play
        volume: Optional volume level (0.0 to 1.0)

    Returns:
        bool: True if song started playing successfully
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Commit Message Format
